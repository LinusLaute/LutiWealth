      <h2>What is Counter-Strike?</h2>
      <p>
        Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter games by Valve. The most well-known version is
        <strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</strong>, a free-to-play title with a massive global player base.
        Players use a Steam account where their in-game items (such as skins and cosmetics) are stored. These items are
        central to our investment strategy, as they have real market value and are traded daily.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What are Gaming Cosmetics?</h2>
      <p>
        Gaming cosmetics — often called "skins" — are purely visual items that change the appearance of weapons or characters in games like CS:GO.
        They don't affect gameplay but are highly sought after for collection, trade, and display.
      </p>
      <p>Items can be obtained through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Opening loot crates (cases) that contain items of varying rarity</li>
        <li>Trading up: combining 10 skins of the same rarity to get 1 skin of higher rarity (10% chance each)</li>
        <li>Random drops after matches or from participating in official events</li>
        <li>Buying directly from marketplaces like BUFF or SkinBaron</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How is this different from traditional investing?</h2>
      <p>Investing in gaming cosmetics comes with unique market mechanics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Trade Hold:</strong> Every item transferred between Steam accounts is locked for 7 days before it can be traded again.
          This makes rapid flipping impossible — a long-term mindset is essential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liquidity:</strong> Volume is low compared to traditional markets. Selling high-ticket items often requires patience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Each Steam account has limited inventory capacity (1,000 items). Extra storage units can be purchased, but
          managing thousands of items efficiently is operationally complex — creating a natural entry barrier.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does the Arbitrage Bot work?</h2>
      <p>
        Our in-house bot monitors online marketplaces in real-time (primarily SkinBaron) and identifies pricing mismatches.
        It executes trades automatically when profit thresholds are met, adjusting for fees, cooldowns, and risk limits.
        This allows us to capitalize on small, short-lived inefficiencies that manual traders would miss.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is this legal?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Buying, selling, and trading CS:GO cosmetics is fully permitted within Steam's terms of service and marketplace rules,
        as long as you follow platform policies. Our bot respects all API and trading rules on third-party marketplaces.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why invest in this market at all?</h2>
      <p>
        Gaming cosmetics are part of a rising category of <strong>digital consumer goods</strong>. 
        They combine elements of collectibles, scarcity, and utility, and they appeal to a young, global, tech-savvy demographic.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's an overlooked market with real upside — and unlike NFTs, these assets have actual use cases and user demand.
